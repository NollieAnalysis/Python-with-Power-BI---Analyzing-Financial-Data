Python with Power BI: Analyzing Financial Data

Coursera guided project practicing python integration into Microsoft BI's platform. Course taught by Abhishek Jha.

Coursera's description of course:
"In this project, we will create a Financial dashboard for assets like stock and crypto.
The dashboard will be dynamic in nature meaning you will be able to get important information 
and graphs about any stock just by replacing the ticker symbol without ever leaving Power BI. 
The project begins with you importing real-time financial data from Yahoo Finance using Python libraries. 
You will harness the power of Python libraries and custom visuals in Power BI to visualize the data, creating 
approximately 10 different charts and graphs to analyze price and volume movement. 
This will be very helpful if you work in Finance or need to present Financial data to clients. 
Currently, financial websites provide limited visualizations. By using Python with Power BI, 
you can present financial data to clients in a far better way than currently available on internet. 
You can add tremendous value by incorporating python with Power BI."
